## About me

### From Brazil :brazil: | Living in Portugal :portugal:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve been studying about *Software Quality*

Some of the knowledge acquired on this journey are:
- Testing new features/products ensuring they work as expected in an agile context (Scrum methodology)
- Inconsistencies and bugs management and tracking with Jira.

Testing Techniques such as:
- business rules based tests
- equivalence partition
- limit values
- decision tables
- hypothesis-based exploratory, failure histories, heuristics, session-based testing, risk-based testing.

I also have knowledge in:

- BDD and TDD concepts
- backend tests on microservices arquitechture that use the RESTful pattern, using Postman and Swagger
- frontend (web), and mobile (android) manual testing.

Basic knowledge level in test automation, using frameworks like:

- RestAssured and JUnit for REST API testing
- Selenium WebDriver for web frontend testing
- Git for code versioning
